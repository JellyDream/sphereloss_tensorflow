## Introduction

This is a simple re-implemention of a-softmax loss which proposed in paper: [SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063). Please cite it if it helps in your paper.<br>
This just contain a sphereloss and train demo.<br>
Thanks to  [sphereface](https://github.com/wy1iu/sphereface),It gives me a lot of inspiration.
